Watching Beijing Opera and discussing on Japan is indeed no need to be together. Because, for the majority of Chinese,Beijing Opera is a nobody care thing, and the talking on Japan is nearly a collective unconsciousness,never lacking the materials. Hence,the so-called cross realm between seems so unapparent.

 

Beijing Opera, which was called "Pihuang(皮黄)" at the beginning, was matured during the reign time of Emperor Daoguang of Qing Dynasty. Up to the time of Emperor Guangxu, this kind of drama form had been quite popular all through China. For the success, some intellectuals,especially those who likes KunQu, owe it partly even mainly to the support of old Empress Cixi of Qing, the virtual/actcual ruler of China then. Objectively speaking, the widely popularity of Beijing Opera should be ascribed to its high degree ofshowmanship and infinite touching power of singing art. Compared with KunQu,Beijing Opera is more near to the context and people's mood at that time, as well as more excellent actors or actresses. 

 

And yet, its rising was nearly with the whole country's decline. It is said that the old empress was watching the Opera while the Sino-Japanese Warwas being on the sea. In light of historical experience, the label"decadent music" apparently found a plot again, as seen by some persons. Fortunately, a series of matters/facts occurred involved the group in practice completely  had  refuted the opinion, when the Japanese arm invaded China and occupied a vast territory.

 

Having undergone counltess innocent compatroits' death , the Beijing Opera artists, especially like Yang Xiaolou, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, firmly rejected to perform for the invaders, showing and preserving our people'sdignify by behavior, even if the muzzles in the front.Then would like to dierather than to live as colonial slaves. "All my life was portrayed heroesof loyalty, just and trust" as Yang Xiaolou said to those fucking japs andtraitors,"I won't let me be a salve at my old age". These greatconducts won people's respect and esteem.

 

Things written above can be seen as an illustration to represent the link of Beijing Opera and Japan. But, history is, after all, history. Hitherto,the popularity of Beijing Opera have been no longer, yet the loathing in Japanese persists. Much easier have been for some once great people to hold a superficial and deep hate than to appreciate the beauty, since an unknown time.

 

When watching a performance in theater, the audience could applaud loudly for the wonderful set according to traditional custom, in practice this would in largely reach a good effect of interact between actors and audiences if in a appropriate way.From the latter half of 19th century to first half of 20th century, many master actors came out in the stage of Beijing Opera, who had adopted and created a series of magnificent performance and singing form originated not only from their genius but also apperception through life lesson. Therefore, it were these watching focuses that inspired the applause from the inside.

 

Up to this day, not so many people would truly taste the quintessence,although still many people go to see in theater for whatever. Certainly never lacking the knowing-it-well audiences, but the majority are not. Maybe just for sorts of identity sense, they also choose to come over to see, and applaud loudly as the past on the surface, because the wonderful places have been firmly there.

 

Similarly, when subject converting to Japan or Japanese,  some Chinese always make an attempt to find whatsoever to abuse have been sorts of routine things, even pointing at their favorable AV, comic and so on. It is interesting. For what on earth,Identification or conditional reflex? To be sure, it is irrelevant to patriotism ,probably like someone's sense when seeing in theater. So far, out of ignorance, without other reasons, some persons applaud and some persons abuse.

 

Rather than applauding or abusing for something, it would be better tospend enough time in studying on the corresponding themes. No matter for self or others, it will lead to benefits. On Beijing Opera, so many was needed to know, on Japan and Japanese, much more should be learned.  Irrespective of freedom of speech but personal culture state, one should be a responsible man. Thus, keeping silence on something really unknown never makes you humble even a little, while loudly shouting does nothing to distinguish one with an animal.
