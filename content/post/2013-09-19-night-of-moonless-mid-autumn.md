Somewhen,somewhere, I noticed an old building by someone and seized the image by mobile, saving it in SD card and half burying in my heart just for something to say in someday.

Night <wbr>of <wbr>Moonless <wbr>Mid-Autumn


On that day,fellows together seemed full of good mood to got a guess of the building's age,eventually,obviously,no more than a boring range that everybody knows.

For this sort of behavior, I always feel confused and understand nothing for significance but some of social effect in some way that I feel more confused.Actually I have not any intent and interest to dig the riddle.Later on,the talking topic turned into the scope of current background .A new topic came out: how much money would have been involved in removing the old building if so.The content of their following talking doomed to be at the level of junior bullshit already from its beginning.What they wanted to say and already said immediately turned into a piled of useless noise before even a little bit of dust dropped from the building.

That day was not a blue sky day, but brought in a kind of blue feeling in heart.

 

Now, I review again the image during that so-called someday, brewing something between nonsense and senseless.

Dao(道),as a traditional belief in China, is equivalent to immortality beyond the long-existence of  physical body and consciousness or spirit in general sense.To truly experience Dao,which cannot be spoken or thought, one has to emerge itself in Dao though a series of right practice.   This is what the Daoists believed rightly and deeply.

As a side-effect in the persuit of Dao, human's life can get prolonged in some degree through some of this sort of practice and training, by the way,which is not so relevant to true belief.Literally and actually, prolonging is not sufficient to mean ,let alone to realize, persistent and perpetual.However,when a sort of coveting or paranoia get in dominant position driven by a kind of unknown power, the scope of rationality is forced to be covered with its quit, not mention to feel Dao.Through traditional Chinese history, so many empires, even some of them in saint title and highly praised by posterity like Empire Tai of Tang Dynasty, were without exception hastened their death for the persuit of "immortality of life".Everybody had its causes ,which can be analyzed specifically, but the effects were the shared ineffective.

 

This is not a new topic.

One general explanation is to owe this sort of result to these empire's arrogance and ignorance .  Indeed,it is answer which is not worth being disproved or proved,because it is so simple and time is so precious.

One of intentions of the essay is to make some simple things perplex and solved cases in doubt again, so everybody could enjoy a series of rambling .

"Life-immortality is a super-natural thing,that is a kind of (feudal) superstitious."most people would say like that, no matter whether really understand the very meaning or not

After all, for the strict line, it is not easy to locate.Comprehending the nature of science would strengthen the belief for god not weaken.And between rigorous science and non-science exists immense gray areas beyond current people's imagination

At this point,as truly great thinkers could also not deny, science is not essential to judge religion truth .However,something not truthful must be not excluded,too.

From the point of experience,  seeking truth in a wrong way often leads to consequences far away from it.Compared with that, by all mean to achieve an fond delusion more often results in choosing a inappropriate even extreme high risk way to make an attempt.

That is the key.

 

The story of Empire Tai of Tan  should more or less bring several thinking space.

During the early years of his reign, he ever criticized previous emperors, like Emperor Shi of Qin Dynasty and Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty, for their causing heavy harm to country and common people and in the end also to themselves due to their stupid paranoia to live forever.The emperor was so sober and sensible then. But, as shown in history record, he died of eating Dan(丹药), a kind of poisoned pill which was said to be used to become the called immortality. Actually, it makes people feel great sorrow and quite regret rather than strike a series of pointless mock .

 

From relevant historical records, the health condition of Emperor Tai of Tang Dynasty had became quite had from the later years of his reign, but lot of urgent and important problems were waited to be solved and rectified,especially the affair of throne succession.In the light of the condition, he desperately needed a health body and more time to solve the problems that he thought nobody was competent to deal with.

Thus, when some Taoists priests suggested attempting to eat Dan and he did not reject it.

Perhaps he felt that these pills maybe really have some effects, even a little would be good.The consequence was:Until his death, the once brilliant and powerful emperor, the actual builder of Tang Dynasty, was into a more poor health condition and suffering more pains which could get a little reliving when silent reading sutra Master XuanZang teached him

 

This story tastes a kind of feeling of  hero in dire straits.Meanwhile,this story is a typical illustration of using a real bow and arrows to shoot an unreal target in dream.

 

Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, so many clouds cover on the sky.It seems a little dismal. Nevertheless, the moon runs around no matter day or night,spring or autumn.That cute light moon have been glittering in the heart from long long ago.
