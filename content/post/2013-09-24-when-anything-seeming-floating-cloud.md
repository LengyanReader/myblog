Lately,history professor Jiang Peng,FudanUniversity,appeared in Lecture Room of CCTV's 10th channel,opening the lectureof 16 episodes on Emperor Xian of Han dynasty(汉献帝). Shortly after the closing, the professor's same title book came out, whose subtitle isPrequel of Three Kingdoms: Feat of A Puppet Emperor(三国前史：一个傀儡的力量<个人译，非官方>).In this book, professor Jiang emphasizes theimportant role of Emperor Xian of Han dynasty having played in rebuildingsocial order ,maintaining social stability and  achieving the reunificationof the whole country step by step even under the circumstance of without anygood cards to play.The proposing of this idea opens a window for readers,through which something fresh could be aware of and furthermore bring up morethoughts. 




In any case, it can count as an interestingand valuable perspective.

 

Relative speaking, the thread of the book isclear on the whole, the argumentation is without apparent contradicts and theevidences cited  sounds like supportiveliterally.Actually, we can find that all above is not yet sufficient tocompletely prove the idea when taking seriously,and some materials used is evenin controversy.In light of that, no surprisingly,the mode of the book is a sortof view driving material thing. Nevertheless,sticking to so rigorous a querywould lead to the point that many things taken for granted are not so,anotherproblem.

Fortunately,the point is just right,it is nonecessary to dig furthermore ,after all as Confucius said "too much is sobad as not enough."

It is the point that makes us begin to be sure to something again.

 

On the aspect of belief or spirituality,mindis insufficient to say yes or no. That is to say, as the conceptual tool set,mind itself is mere a series of function from noumenon and essence,which is athing of implement level.To be extended, like title,education background,social status ,even power and knowledge,culture,personality,etc,all of thesecan not be equated with one's essence, although nobody denying their respective reference values.Back to the book, in spite of the questioning idea, havingdisprove it in a logical way can't be achieved.

Then what did it come out?

The intuition and inspiration,acquired througha kind of good reading state like meditation, having perceived the vividfeeling and heart of the historical figure.

 

Thus, it presents a splendid perspective,alsoreflecting some aspects of richness and profoundity in human nature. Still someevidences or cases used can be interpreted not less than one way,however,whichis rather interesting.

And interesting is important.

From reading history record, we are not sureto find the right fact but the very complexity.It is just the complexity inhistory that  teaches us to understandthe complexity contained in reality and buried in human nature

 

In the book,the author highly praises thatemperor Xian of Han for just his initiative cooperation with prime minister Caocao(曹操), contributing to political stability andeconomic recovery in northern China since chaos caused by Dong Zhuo（董卓）.Kind of fresh,Professor Jiang points that the outbreakof war of GuanDu(官渡之战) reflected the acutecontradiction between two rival groups,namely,Yuanchao and the emperor, not Caocao as usually says ,with several pieces of evidence.In the end,the author usessome historical documents to argument that Emperor Xian of Han having givenempire throne to Cao Pi,namely Emperor Wen of Wei,is on his own will outof  preserving prospect of the whole countryafter Cao Cao's suddenly death.In addition,some of contributions to culture isalso noted.The author contends Emperor Xian of Han deserves thetitle"Never letting the whole country down(不负苍生)"

 When <wbr>Anything <wbr>Seeming <wbr>Floating <wbr>Cloud


Obviously,the book reads a taste of reversed case.But the taste leads a way to highlight some blindness  rather than gets a conclusion forcing readersto trust in

Emperor Xian of Han, under a situation of hardly without any real power ,should have supported and passed his whole life,meanwhile not wronged the common people, by his own belief in Tian(天道).
    Today, facing anything getting challenged by the sense of nihility,people feel in lost.Then some choose to drift in the current, and still some don't,   because they know some-thing is all there.
