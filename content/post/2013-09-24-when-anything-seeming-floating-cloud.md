Lately,history professor Jiang Peng,Fudan University,appeared in Lecture Room of CCTV's 10th channel,opening the lecture of 16 episodes on Emperor Xian of Han dynasty(汉献帝). Shortly after the closing, the professor's same title book came out, whose subtitle is Prequel of Three Kingdoms: Feat of A Puppet Emperor(三国前史：一个傀儡的力量<个人译，非官方>).In this book, professor Jiang emphasizes the important role of Emperor Xian of Han dynasty having played in rebuilding social order ,maintaining social stability and  achieving the reunificationof the whole country step by step even under the circumstance of without any good cards to play.The proposing of this idea opens a window for readers,through which something fresh could be aware of and further more bring up more thoughts. 




In any case, it can be counted as an interesting and valuable perspective.

 

Relative speaking, the thread/line of the book is clear on the whole, the argumentation is without apparent contradicts and the evidences cited  sounds like supportive literally.Actually, we can find that all above is not yet sufficient to completely prove the idea when taking seriously,and some materials used is even in controversy.In light of that, no surprisingly,the mode of the book is a sort of view driving material thing. Nevertheless,sticking to so rigorous a query would lead to the point that many things taken for granted are not so,anotherproblem.

Fortunately,the point is just right,it is nonecessary to dig furthermore ,after all as Confucius said "too much is so bad as not enough."

It is the point that makes us begin to be sure to something again.

 

On the aspect of belief or spirituality,mind is insufficient to say yes or no. That is to say, as the conceptual tool set,mind itself is mere a series of function from noumenon and essence,which is a thing of implement level.To be extended, like title,education background,social status ,even power and knowledge,culture,personality,etc,all of these can not be equated with one's essence, although nobody denying their respective reference values.Back to the book, in spite of the questioning idea, having disprove it in a logical way can't be achieved.

Then what did it come out?

The intuition and inspiration,acquired througha kind of good reading state like meditation, having perceived the vivid feeling and heart of the historical figure.

 

Thus, it presents a splendid perspective,also reflecting some aspects of richness and profoundity in human nature. Still some evidences or cases used can be interpreted not less than one way,however,which is rather interesting.

And interesting is important.

From reading history record, we are not sure to find the right fact but the very complexity.It is just the complexity in history that  teaches us to understand the complexity contained in reality and buried in human nature

 

In the book,the author highly praises that emperor Xian of Han for just his initiative cooperation with prime minister Caocao(曹操), contributing to political stability and economic recovery in northern China since chaos caused by Dong Zhuo（董卓）.Kind of fresh,Professor Jiang points that the outbreakof war of GuanDu(官渡之战) reflected the acute contradiction between two rival groups,namely,Yuanchao and the emperor, not Caocao as usually says ,with several pieces of evidence.In the end,the author uses some historical documents to argument that Emperor Xian of Han having given empire throne to Cao Pi,namely Emperor Wen of Wei,is on his own will outof  preserving prospect of the whole country after Cao Cao's suddenly death.In addition,some of contributions to culture is also noted.The author contends Emperor Xian of Han deserves the title"Never letting the whole country down(不负苍生)"

 When <wbr>Anything <wbr>Seeming <wbr>Floating <wbr>Cloud


Obviously,the book reads a taste of reversed case.But the taste leads a way to highlight some blindness  rather than gets a conclusion forcing readersto trust in

Emperor Xian of Han, under a situation of hardly without any real power ,should have supported and passed his whole life,meanwhile not wronged the common people, by his own belief in Tian(天道).
    Today, facing anything getting challenged by the sense of nihility,people feel in lost.Then some choose to drift in the current, and still some don't,   because they know some-thing is all there.
