<p>As a dataman, We people’s attitude toward CS or IT guy’s stuff is not possible to the field of interesting. What is cared by me are convenience,effiency and easy-learning,as to other features,at least for now it is not my focuse</p>
<p>Git is a good tool to manage codes,and rstudio is so friendly to rusers, and the r-code’s management needs both of them working together, so the blog is written for this.</p>
